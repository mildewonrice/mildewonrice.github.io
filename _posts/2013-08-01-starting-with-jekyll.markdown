I decided it is time to finally make a blog. I did not want to use a bloated CMS or any templates, but I also did not want to do *all* of it from scratch. I just needed a light, static website that would allow me to easily post blog entries.  A good friend showed me [Jekyll][jekyll] and I realized it is exactly what I was looking for. Jekyll is a "simple, blog aware, static site generator" which means that I just have to create a set of HTML/CSS templates and then create the content in seperate files. Jekyll will use my content files with my templates in order to generate the site. It took only a matter of minutes for me to get it install and I am pretty impressed with it so far. It is working exactly like I expected it to. 

I am also using [Skeleton][skeleton] as a CSS framework for this site. Skeleton is just a few CSS files that helps create responsive and mobile friendly websites. It was as simple as downloading the files and then linking my HTML to use them as the stylesheets. I need to mess around with it some more before I pass judgement though. I may also try out [Bootstrap][bootstrap], which is Twitter's responsive CSS framework, as it seems to have a larger following and it has more widgets and UI tools that I may find useful as this site comes along.
